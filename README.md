## 🟢 But why are we doing this for free?

<p>
  Since StartSe was founded our purpose has always been to "provoke new beginnings".  
Driven by this, we work every day to inspire and enable thousands of leaders and companies to continuously transform themselves.
 
And in this context, technology has always been an important part.

However, we are now faced with a major dilemma. How to encourage companies to accelerate their digital transformation if there is a lack of professionals in the market?

We then realized that we, at StartSe, had to take a leading role.
We want to do our part and help "provoke a new beginning" for Brazil.

That's why we created the StartSe TechAcademy, our Free Academy for Training Developers that was born with a dream: over half a million people becoming certified with us in the coming years.

The StartSe TechAcademy was developed with this in mind. It aims to freely include people from all corners of Brazil who are in search of new opportunities, a new career path, a fresh start.

And the more we succeed in this dream, the more we will be contributing to accelerate the transformation of the country.
